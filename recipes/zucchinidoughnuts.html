    <h2>Sweet baked Zucchini Doughnuts with Cinnamon Maple Glaze</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet baked Zucchini Doughnuts with Cinnamon Maple Glaze. Made with
      shredded zucchini, whole wheat flour, cinnamon, and just a pinch of
      ginger. Then baked and dipped in a sweet brown butter glaze flavored with
      coffee and cinnamon. There’s really nothing not to love about these cute
      summery spiced doughnuts. The perfect way to use that summer zucchini!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 medium zucchini, grated (about 1 1/2 cups grated before squeezing out
        water)
      </li>
      <li>1/3 cup coconut oil, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 cup maple syrup</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or all-purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350° F. Grease a 6-cup doughnut pan or 12-cup muffin
        pan with melted butter
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay a clean towel on the counter with the shredded zucchini in the
        center, then squeeze out any excess water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, stir together the coconut oil, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla
        until combined. Mix in the squeezed-out zucchini. Add the flour, baking
        powder, cinnamon, ginger, and salt. Mix until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the batter evenly among the molds, filling 1/2-2/3 of the way
        full. Bake for 12 minutes, until just set. Remove and let cool 5
        minutes. Then run a knife around the edges to release, and invert the
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the glaze. Add the butter to a small pot set over medium
        heat. Allow the butter to brown slightly until it smells toasted, about
        2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the maple syrup, powdered
        sugar, instant coffee, and cinnamon. Dip or drizzle the doughnuts into
        the glaze. Highly recommend eating a few of these warm!
