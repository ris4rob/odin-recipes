    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 strips thick-cut bacon, chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated</li>
      <li>2 medium shallots, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 inch fresh ginger, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 cups baby spinach, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>3/4 cup coconut milk (or preferred milk)</li>
      <li>8 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and cook
        until crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, shallots, ginger, and red
        pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, about 3
        minutes. Pour in the broth, milk, and soy sauce, then whisk in the miso
        and chili paste. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make the Katsu. Place the Panko and sesame seeds in a shallow
        bowl. Season with salt. Dredge both sides of the chicken through the
        Panko, pressing to adhere by using your fist to really pound the crumbs
        in. Place the chicken on a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add
        the chicken and cook until golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken
        and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 3-4 minutes.
        Transfer to a cutting board and season with salt. Slice into thin
        strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the soup, stir in the noodles, spinach, and sesame oil. Let sit 5
        minutes or until the noodles are soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, divide the noodles between bowls and ladle over the soup back
        overtop. Add the chicken. Top as desired with eggs, green onions, sesame
        seeds, and chili oil. Serve immediately.
