    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-size chunks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>3 bell peppers</li>
      <li>1 cup Tzakiki sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons mayo</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>6 ounces crumbled feta cheese</li>
      <li>peperoncini, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the vinaigrette: combine all ingredients in a bowl or glass jar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the chicken, half of the vinaigrette, and the paprika in a bowl.
        Thread the chicken onto the skewers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set your grill, grill pan, or skillet to medium-high heat. Grill the
        peppers until charred all over, place in a large bowl, cover and let
        steam for 10 minutes. Remove the charred skin, then deseed and slice the
        peppers. Submerge the charred peppers in the vinaigrette.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simultaneously grill the skewers until lightly charred and cooked
        through, turning them occasionally throughout cooking, about 10 to 12
        minutes total.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the Tzaziki sauce with the mayo and lemon juice. Stir in
        the crumbled feta.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, add the rice to a bowl. Top with peppers, chicken, and any
        other desired toppings. Add a few dollops of feta. Dress with Tzaziki
        sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
